AirBnB Clone - Command Interpreter
Project Description
This project is the first step toward building a full web application of the AirBnB clone. In this first part, we will create a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects. The command interpreter will allow us to do the following:

Create new objects (e.g., users, cities, places)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
Perform operations on the objects (like updating, deleting)
Store and persist data
This console will be a simple command-line interface that processes commands through specific functions.

Command Interpreter
How to Start
The command interpreter can be launched in two modes:

Interactive mode: When launched without any input, it will wait for commands.
Non-interactive mode: When commands are piped or given in one line.

How to Start
The command interpreter can be launched in two modes:

Interactive mode: When launched without any input, it will wait for commands.
Non-interactive mode: When commands are piped or given in one line.
Interactive Mode
Start the console by running the console.py file:

bash
Copy code
$ ./console.py
You will see the prompt (hbnb) where you can type commands:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
You can exit the console by typing quit or EOF:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb) quit
$
Non-Interactive Mode
You can pass commands directly without interactive input:

bash
Copy code
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
This will output:

bash
Copy code
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
How to Use It
Here are the available commands:

help: Displays a list of available commands and how to use them.
quit: Exits the program.
create: Creates a new instance of a specified class.
show: Displays the string representation of an instance based on its class and ID.
destroy: Deletes an instance based on its class and ID.
all: Displays all instances or instances of a specified class.
update: Updates attributes of a specific instance.
